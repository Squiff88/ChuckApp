# ChuckApp using Async / await functions an REST API to make request to the server

This Desktop App is based on free API for Chuck Norris Jokes Database

You can find the source API here /http://www.icndb.com/api/ /

The app is using json server package (from npm pack)
to simulate database-like JSON object.

In order to run and use the app correctly ,
you have to fire up such a json server package.

This is done in 2 simple commands in your git bash or terminal

- $ npm install -g json-server // Install the json server package globally on you machine

- $ json-server db.json // Create and run the database

With these simple steps now you can run the ChuckApp with its all features.

Enjoy
